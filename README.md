# WhileCompiler
A basic while compiler

This project is an application of all of the major concepts of project-oriented programming in a compiler which turns "while" code (String) into a virtual machine executable code.
More specifically, the target machine is XVM (X Virtual Machine, a custom VM derived from JVM and developed by Pierre-Yves Strub professor at Ecole Polytechnique).
More details about the architecture of the code and the project can be found (in French) at:
